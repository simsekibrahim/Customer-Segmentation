# RFM Customer Segmentation & Cohort Analysis Project
Welcome to the "RFM Customer Segmentation and Cohort Analysis Project".

This is a project where we learn what RFM is. And we looked at how to implement RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering. We have also enhanced our Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis capabilities. On the other hand, we created Cohort and Conducted Cohort Analysis.
